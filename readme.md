# Kirby Vue Starter Simple

This is a **simple** starter for working with Kirby and Vue together.

## What is Kirby?

Kirby is a file-based CMS.
Easy to setup. Easy to use. Flexible as hell.

## What is Vue?

A progressive, incrementally-adoptable JavaScript framework for building UI on the web.

## Usage

You'll need to serve Kirby locally somehow. [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) is a possibility for this.

Compile assets on the fly as you develop
```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Create an asset build ready for production
```bash
$ npm run build
```
